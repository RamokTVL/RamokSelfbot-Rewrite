# RamokSelfbot-Rewritten
DISCORD : https://discord.gg/GxvKJ5kgPR
I made this project for learn c#, this is not the best selfbot ever (lol its a beta and the only opensource selfbot in c# that i know the existence) 

# First start !
When you download the selfbot, the first thing you need to do before launching the bot is : 

- Set your token at token.txt
- Customize the bot

 # Set your token 
   
   - Use this tutorial to get your token, and then put it in token.txt : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI
   - (Do not share this string to nobody, only this is necessary for login to ur Discord account, this bypass A2F too !)
 # Customize the bot
   
   API KEYS : 
   - Go create a tenor api key here : https://tenor.com/gifapi/documentation
   - Go create a giphy api key here : https://developers.giphy.com/

   - And you can change the prefix in the config.json only for now but for V2 you will can change it directly from the selfbot.

   - (You can modify embed color in the selfbot without restarting !)

# FOR THE DEVLOPPERS

  - If you want to reuse the code, keep my name in it
  - Keep my name in the README.md
  - Make an credits command with my name in it 
  

  - OR ITS SKID.
