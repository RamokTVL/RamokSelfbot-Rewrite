# RamokSelfbot-Rewritten
DISCORD : https://discord.gg/GxvKJ5kgPR

I made this project to learn c#, this is not the best selfbot ever (lol its a beta and the only opensource selfbot in c# that i know the existence) 

# Legality
The selfbot has been made for educational purposes. I do not take responsability on the bad usage of this selfbot.

# First start !
When you download the selfbot, the first thing you need to do before launching the bot is : 

- Set your token at token.txt
- Customize the bot

Or : 

- Check your files with argument "/checkfiles"
- Open the selfbot with argument "/config"

 # Set your token 
   
   - Use this tutorial to get your token, and then put it in token.txt : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI
   - (Do not share this string to nobody, only this is necessary for login to ur Discord account, this bypass A2F too !)
			
 # Customize the bot
   
   API KEYS : 
   
   - Create a Youtube API key here : https://console.developers.google.com/
   

   - (You can modify embed color in the selfbot without restarting !)

# FOR THE DEVLOPPERS

  - If you want to reuse the code, keep my name in it
  - Keep my name in the README.md
  - Make an credits command with my name in it 
  

  - OR ITS SKID.
